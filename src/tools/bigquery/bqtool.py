    This tool enables users to query comprehensive World Bank datasets using natural language. \
    It supports exploration of global economic, health, education, debt, and demographic indicators. \
    Sense check your answers with your own general knowledge. \
    Provide retrieved data everytime to serve as objective evidence for your answers \
    Converts natural language to SQL query and executes it. IMPORTANT: strictly follow this order of actions:
    1. BigQueryToolAction.GetMetadata - get database tables structure (metadata)
    2. BigQueryToolAction.Query - execute the generated SQL query
